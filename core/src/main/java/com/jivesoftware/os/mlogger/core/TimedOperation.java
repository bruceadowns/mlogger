/**
 * Used to gather operation metric data.<br/>
 * The metric data is used to mine the health and performance of the system with high granularity.<br/>
 * <p>
 * Timed operation will measure 4 metrics:<br/>
 * 1. The number of times the operation was executed (name).<br/>
 * 2. The number of times the operation has finished in each status (name>NONE, name>SUCCESS, name>FAILED, etc).<br/>
 * 3. The time the operation execution took (name).<br/>
 * 4. The time the operation execution took and finished in each status (name>NONE, name>SUCCESS, name>FAILED, etc).<br/>
 * It is also possible to add metric counts to the operation using {@link #inc(String, long)} where the
 * subName will be added to the name of the operation (name>subName).<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b><br/>
 * <pre>
 * try(TimedOperation op = LOG.startTimedOperation("loadData>step1", tenantId)){
 *     // load data code...
 *     op.setSuccessful();
 *     return data;
 * }l
 * </pre>
 * {@link TimedOperation} will automatically measure the time between the start and the close of
 * the operation at the end of the scope.<br/>
 * If the operation suceed it will reach the {@link #setSuccessful()} method to indicate it was successful, if
 * the operation failed by exception it will not reach the method so the operation will be NONE.<br/>
 * You can pass {@link TimedOperation.Status#FAILED} to {@link MetricLogger#startTimedOperation} as the initial
 * operation status so if exception is thrown the operation status will be FAILED and only if it reaches
 * the end it will be SUCCESS.<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Metrics granularity</b><br/>
 * 1. MetrixLogger - Encapsulates the name of the class that collects the metrics, sets the component
 * part of the system for the collected matrics (part of the heirarchiel name of the operation).<br/>
 * 2. Name - Custom free text name that can have heirarchiel structure (using '>' splitter), this
 * allows creation of metrics for operations and sub-operation to increase mining granularity.<br/>
 * 3. Tenant - Optional, ability to split metrics for each tenant.<br/>
 * 4. Status - Split the metric data to successful and failed operations.<br/>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important of Tenant</b><br/>
 * In a multi tenant environment we want to have the ability to slice the metrics by tenant to understand
 * the real expirience that a specific tenant is having.<br/>
 * In the most simplest terms we want to be sure each tenant is receiving the SLA we are aspiring for.
 * </p>d
 * <p>
 * <b>Important of Status</b><br/>
 * The most critical factor for the health of the system, seperating the successful and failed operation
 * and factoring the elapsed times of the operations is the best indication if the system is working properly.<br/>
 * Additionally having seperate status for validation failures allows to minigate the false alarms for
 * large amount of failures and incorrect timing data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Backend support</b><br/>
 * TODO: Need work to make this data actually visible by the backend ops services.
 * </p>
